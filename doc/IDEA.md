# IntelliJ IDEA

IDEA supports Gradle out of the box.
Just make sure to import as a Gradle project into IDEA.

There a few settings that you are recommended to set IDEA to run Gradle with IDEA.
This will allow you to use debugging and will run faster.

## Notes

**DO NOT** run the legacy `idea` task in Gradle.
The legacy `idea` task will mess up the project configuration.

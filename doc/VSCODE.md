# Visual Studio Code

**At the moment support for VS Code is mostly unimplemented.**

You will need to install an extension in order to have Java support.

The [Language support for Java by Red Hat]<!-- or [Java Language Support by George Fraser]--> extension should be suitable.

You will probably need to install a newer JDK for development with VS Code, Java 11 for redhat's plugin and Java 13 for
George's.
You can install a [JDK here].
The latest version of Java is best, as you can compile for Java 8.

Red Hat's plugin is also included in the [Java Extension pack].
If you use the Java Extension pack, the [Debugger for Java] extension can also be installed.

# Test projects

This folder contains test projects used to functionally test the plugin.
Functional tests cover both Groovy and Kotlin buildscripts.

Simply creating a new directory in the `groovy` or `kotlin` folder will generate a new project.
You can disable specific test projects by creating an empty `DISABLE` file in the test project's directory.

Much of the structure of the test projects came from [Gradle].
